# Specification Quality Checklist: Recording & OSS Upload & Database Workflow

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All items pass validation. This specification documents an existing implementation, so all details are derived from actual code analysis.

**Sections documented**:
- User Scenarios & Testing (4 user stories with acceptance scenarios)
- Workflow Architecture (4 phases)
- Functional Requirements (10 requirements)
- Key Entities (4 entities)
- Configuration (2 config files)
- Success Criteria (6 measurable outcomes)
- Assumptions (5 assumptions)
